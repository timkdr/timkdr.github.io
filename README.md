# JavaScript Emoji Selector

I'd like to show you how we can create an easy-to-use emoji selector for any website or application. We'll use the browser's built-in `fetch` API to connect to the `open-emoji API` to display a list of all emojis. If you'd like to code along with me, be sure to download the repository for this project to your machine and follow along with this README.md file, or you can check out our blog article to follow along as well. Alternatively, if videos are more your thing, check out our video tutorial on this project.

## Getting Started
I have built out a simple chat-app application. The HTML markup as well as the styles for this project are already completed. We will only be going over the JavaScript functionality inside of the `app.js` file. So with that said, the only prerequisites would be to understand some basic JavaScript. Our JavaScripts Basics Course (linked below) can get you started with that if you need a refresher. I'll also list below our course that goes into much more detail with `fetch()`.

 Let's get started!

## How to Toggle the Emoji Menu
The first step in building out this feature to our chat-app is to show and hide the emoji menu when the emoji icon is clicked. This is very easy to do, so let's get started there.

If you take a look at the project in the browser and then inspect the page, you'll see that the emoji icon is a list item with the id of `emojiSelectorIcon`. The list item directly above that is actually our menu. By default, it is hidden but if we give it a class of `active`, it will be visible. This list item for our menu has an id of `emojiSelector`. Let's use both of these ids and create some variables.

In our `app.js` file:

```
const emojiSelectorIcon = document.getElementById('emojiSelectorIcon');
const emojiSelector = document.getElementById('emojiSelector');
```

Now that we have the variables set up for our emoji-icon and our emoji-selector, let's toggle that `active` class on the menu when the icon is clicked.

In our `app.js` file:

```
emojiSelectorIcon.addEventListener('click', () => {
    emojiSelector.classList.toggle('active');
});
```

You should now see the menu open and close when clicking the emoji icon.

## How to use the fetch API

Next, we'll need to add in our emojis. You'll notice in the HTML that inside of our list-item for our menu, there is a ul with the id of `emojiList`. This is where we will append all of our emojis to the DOM. 

Head on over to the [Open Emoji API](https://emoji-api.com/)
You should see a field for you to put in your email address with a button saying <b><i>get a key</i></b>. Go ahead and put in a valid email address. You'll then receive your API key.

Do not copy my key. Be sure to create your own by providing your email address. Once you have your API key, scroll down to "Documentation" and you'll notice all the different API endpoints. The only one we'll be using for this project is the first one titled "List all emojis". You should notice your API key at the end of the link for the API after "?access_key=". If not, be sure to copy that link and then add in your API key.

`https://emoji-api.com/emojis?access_key=<YOUR API KEY>`

Once all of that is ready, it's time to hop back into our `app.js` file and start connecting to this API.

In our `app.js` file:

```
fetch('https://emoji-api.com/emojis?access_key=<YOUR API KEY>')
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data))
```

Inside of the `''` in our fetch method, paste in your API endpoint with your API key. Because fetch returns a promise, we can chain on a `.then()` method. If our response comes back okay (`res.status === 200`) we will convert it to json by writing `.then(res => res.json())`. We will get back some data. You'll notice that I am taking this data and logging it to the console. I typically always do this when working with an API to make sure we are getting data back. If you hit save and checkout the console in your browser, you should see an array holding all of our emojis.

<img src="./images/console.png">

We will want to loop over every emoji and create a list-item for that emoji. Then append that list-item to our parent `ul`. This would be perfect for a function. We can pass the `data` holding our emojis from the API call as a parameter and run a `forEach` loop on that data. This is what that will look like:

```
function loadEmoji(data) {
    data.forEach(emoji => {
        let li = document.createElement('li');
        li.textContent = emoji.character;
        emojiList.appendChild(li);
    });
}
```

Above, I created a function named `loadEmoji` and passed in `data` as a parameter. Inside of this function, we're running a loop on `data`, which will hold each item in our array that we're getting back from our API call. Each array item in the array is an object with that specific emoji's data. Here is one for example:

```
character: "ðŸ‘»",
codePoint: "1F47B",
group: "smileys-emotion",
slug: "ghost",
subGroup: "face-costume",
unicodeName: "ghost"
```
 We are first creating a new `li` element and then setting the `textContent` of our `li` to the `character` of our object. Then, we're appending that new `li` to our parent `ul`. That's all we'll need for our function. So now we need to call it. Lets replace our `console.log(data)` in our `.then()` method to `loadEmoji(data)`. Now when we get back data from our API call, it'll run that function, which loops over all the data and creates a `li` element with our emoji as the `textContent`. 

 ðŸ¥³ ðŸŽ‰ Great work! You should now see all the emojis when clicking on the emoji icon!

 Your finished code should look like this:

 ```
const emojiSelectorIcon = document.getElementById('emojiSelectorIcon');
const emojiSelector = document.getElementById('emojiSelector');

emojiSelectorIcon.addEventListener('click', () => {
    emojiSelector.classList.toggle('active');
});

fetch('https://emoji-api.com/emojis?access_key=<YOUR API KEY>')
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => loadEmoji(data))

function loadEmoji(data) {
    data.forEach(emoji => {
        let li = document.createElement('li');
        li.textContent = emoji.character;
        emojiList.appendChild(li);
    });
}
```
